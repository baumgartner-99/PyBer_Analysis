# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze ride sharing data by city type: rural, urban, or suburban. Components of this analysis include a new Dataframe showing information grouped by city type and a multiline chart to visualize total fares for each city type. 

## Results

The following image shows the new Dataframe with information grouped by city type:

As you can see from this image, there is information on total rides, total drivers, total fares, and averages based on city types.

This next image shows the multiline chart of total fares for each city type:

As you can see from this image, rural fares are much lower than urban fares.

## Summary
Based on these results, these are my three business recommendations to address disparities in city types: 
  - Fares for rural cities could be more expensive when demand is higher to help drive revenue upwards and closer to urban revenues.
  - There could be less drivers in urban areas so the average fare per driver increases.
  - Minimize the gap between total rides and total drivers for urban and rural areas, as this will pull averages towards the middle.
